# Anki-Connect API v1

Use this API for new integrations. It provides named methods, typed records, explicit
completion for long-running work, and structured errors. Existing applications can
continue using the [legacy API](API_LEGACY.md) at `/`.

Anki Desktop must be running with the add-on enabled. This rewrite requires Anki
26.08 or later; the test matrix covers 26.08 and 26.09.3. Call `api.describe` to check which
methods are available in the current runtime. Native tests cover both protocols. GUI scenarios require a working display;
network sync requires a disposable account and separate integration testing.

## Quick start

Send UTF-8 JSON to `POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1`:

```bash
curl --request POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1 \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"decks.list","params":{}}'
```

A successful response has the same request ID and a `result`:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":[{"id":"1","name":"Default","kind":"normal","presetId":"1"}]}
```

### Python client

This helper uses Python's standard library. Copy it into your application, then use
`call("decks.list")` or `call("notes.search", query="deck:Default")`.

```python
import itertools
import json
import time
import urllib.request

ENDPOINT = "http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1"
API_KEY = None  # Set to the configured apiKey, if enabled.
request_ids = itertools.count(1)


def call(method, **params):
    request_id = next(request_ids)
    body = {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": request_id, "method": method, "params": params}
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    if API_KEY is not None:
        headers["Authorization"] = f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
    request = urllib.request.Request(
        ENDPOINT, json.dumps(body).encode("utf-8"), headers=headers, method="POST"
    )
    with urllib.request.urlopen(request) as response:
        reply = json.load(response)
    if reply.get("id") != request_id:
        raise RuntimeError("Unexpected response ID")
    if "error" in reply:
        raise RuntimeError(reply["error"])
    return reply["result"]


def wait_for_operation(handle, timeout=300):
    deadline = time.monotonic() + timeout
    delay = 0.25
    while True:
        operation = call("operations.get", operationId=handle["operationId"])
        if operation["state"] == "succeeded":
            return operation["result"]
        if operation["state"] in ("failed", "cancelled"):
            raise RuntimeError(operation["error"])
        if time.monotonic() >= deadline:
            raise TimeoutError("Operation is still pending; retain the handle")
        time.sleep(delay)
        delay = min(delay * 1.5, 2)


print(call("decks.list"))
```

The polling timeout is a client choice. It does not cancel server work.

### JavaScript client

Use this helper from an environment with `fetch`, such as a browser extension or
modern Node.js. Browser requests also need an allowed origin.

```javascript
const endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1";
const apiKey = null; // Set to the configured apiKey, if enabled.
let nextId = 1;

async function call(method, params = {}) {
  const id = nextId++;
  const headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"};
  if (apiKey !== null) headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${apiKey}`;
  const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
    method: "POST",
    headers,
    body: JSON.stringify({jsonrpc: "2.0", id, method, params}),
  });
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
  const reply = await response.json();
  if (reply.id !== id) throw new Error("Unexpected response ID");
  if (reply.error) throw Object.assign(new Error(reply.error.message), {rpc: reply.error});
  return reply.result;
}

async function main() {
  console.log(await call("decks.list"));
}
main().catch(console.error);
```

## Requests, authentication, and errors

The endpoint uses JSON-RPC 2.0 with **named parameters**. `params` may be omitted
when empty. Always send an `id` for commands. Entity IDs are decimal strings;
request IDs may be strings, integers, or null. `/api/v1` is the API version and `"2.0"`
is the JSON-RPC protocol version.

If `apiKey` is configured, include `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Authentication
is disabled when the key is null. Origin permission is checked separately using
`webCorsOriginList` and `ignoreOriginList`. `access.requestPermission` uses the
actual HTTP origin, is exempt from the API key check, and never returns the key.

JSON-RPC results and errors use HTTP 200, including parse errors. Transport
rejections have empty bodies: 401 for an invalid key, 403 for a rejected origin,
405 for a non-POST request, and 413 for an oversized body. Check the HTTP status
before parsing JSON. OPTIONS replies support browser preflight for JSON and
Authorization headers, including from origins awaiting permission. Preflight
does not grant access: each POST still checks origin permission and authentication.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"error":{"code":1001,"message":"Note not found.","data":{"type":"notFound"}}}
```

Match `error.data.type` or `error.code`, rather than the human-readable message.
Standard codes are -32700 (parse error), -32600 (invalid request), -32601 (unknown
method), -32602 (invalid parameters), and -32603 (internal error).

| Code | Error type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | `notFound` | A referenced resource does not exist. |
| 1002 | `validationFailed` | Content or native validation failed. |
| 1003 | `editorConflict` | An open editor prevents the requested change. |
| 1004 | `collectionUnavailable` | No collection is open. |
| 1005 | `staleSession` | The collection session changed. |
| 1006 | `unsupportedCapability` | The runtime cannot safely perform this method. |
| 1007 | `cancelled` | The operation was cancelled. |
| 1008 | `conflict` | A token or resource conflicts with current state. |
| 1009 | `invalidState` | The GUI or scheduler is in an incompatible state. |
| 1010 | `busy` | A lifecycle transition or capacity limit prevents admission. |
| 1011 | `authenticationRequired` | Anki sync credentials are unavailable. |
| 1012 | `ioError` | File, download, import, or export failed. |
| 1013 | `invalidSearch` | Anki rejected the search query. |
| 1014 | `staleCursor` | A cursor expired or belongs to another session. |
| 1015 | `vetoed` | A reviewer hook prevented the answer. |
| 1016 | `compatibilityError` | A legacy request cannot be translated safely. |

Additional error details may identify invalid inputs with JSON pointers or item
indexes. `retryable` is advisory. A request ID is not an idempotency key: do not
retry a write automatically after losing its response.

## Working with collections

- Get the current `session` with `collection.get` and pass it to subsequent
  collection methods. A stale session fails before work. Without an explicit
  session, the server captures the current session at admission and checks it
  again at execution. IDs belong to a collection, so reacquire them after switching
  profiles. Switching invalidates cursors, scheduling tokens, and editor history.
- Reference a deck, preset, or note type with exactly one of `{"id":"1"}` or
  `{"name":"Default"}`. Reads never create missing resources.
- Fields contain HTML. Field names are exact. Updates change only supplied
  properties; note field patches merge by name, while supplied tags replace the
  entire tag set. Null is accepted only where documented. Empty patches fail.
- Bulk results use `{"items":[...]}` with the original `index` and either `result`
  or `error` for each item. Shape errors reject the whole request. Item failures
  are otherwise independent unless the method documents atomic behavior.
- `notes.update` and note-scoped `tags.add`, `tags.remove`, and `tags.replace`
  save and refresh one affected open editor. Pending edits in omitted fields are
  preserved; supplied API properties take precedence. Input pauses until refresh
  completes. Other writes and multiple affected editor windows still require
  closing those editors. An operation may require user interaction in Anki.
- Timestamps use RFC 3339 UTC. Intervals include units. Scheduling day numbers
  belong to Anki's collection epoch, rather than Unix time. SM-2 ease is in
  permille; FSRS stability and difficulty are separate values.

### Undo behavior

Method entries label their undo behavior: `single` creates one entry, `perItem`
creates independent entries, and `perItemOrAtomic` depends on the atomic option.
`perCommand` follows each ordered command’s behavior. `clears` clears existing
undo history; `none` creates no collection undo entry. `undo` performs native undo.
Undo grouping does not imply a transaction across multiple native calls.

### Search and pagination

Search uses Anki's query syntax; an empty query matches everything. The default
page size is 100 and the maximum is 1000. Search results use ascending ID order
unless a browser column sort is supplied. Explicit sorts use Anki's native browser
ordering; `column` is a browser column key such as `noteFld` or `cardDue`.

```python
session = call("collection.get")["session"]
cursor = None
while True:
    params = {"query": "deck:Default", "limit": 100, "session": session}
    if cursor is not None:
        params["cursor"] = cursor
    page = call("notes.search", **params)
    print(page["ids"])
    cursor = page["nextCursor"]
    if cursor is None:
        break
```

Repeat the same query, sort, and limit on subsequent pages. Cursors snapshot the
ordered matching IDs for ten minutes: deleted resources are omitted, and newly
matching resources appear in a new search. Review pagination likewise snapshots
IDs; `afterId` is exclusive. Methods without cursors return their whole list.
Each successful continuation consumes its cursor; use the returned `nextCursor`
for the following page. Completing a search releases its snapshot. Up to 100
unfinished snapshots can be retained, each containing at most 1,000,000 IDs.

### Operations and ordered commands

Methods marked **operation** return an `OperationHandle`, rather than their final
result. Poll `operations.get`, or use `wait_for_operation` above. States are
`queued`, `running`, `waitingForUser`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled`.
Only terminal records contain a result or error. Handles remain readable after
profile switching, but are lost when Anki restarts.

```python
handle = call("browser.open", query="deck:Default")
selection = wait_for_operation(handle)
print(selection)
```

A completed method replies after its required work and notifications. An operation
succeeds after its final work and notifications. `application.exit` is a special
case: its reply acknowledges a scheduled close; user dialogs can still prevent exit.

`operations.cancel` requests supported cancellation. Check `cancellable` first;
a cancellation can race with success and does not undo changes already committed.
Disconnecting a client does not cancel accepted work. Operations are retained for
one hour after completion, with at most 1000 terminal and 100 active records.

A JSON-RPC batch array does not order commands and does not create a transaction.
For ordered execution, use `api.execute`: it waits for each command's final
outcome, continues after errors, and returns an operation whose final result has
item results. It does not substitute earlier results into later parameters.
Nested execute, profile switching, and application exit are prohibited inside it.
Notifications omit `id`, return HTTP 204, and execute only read methods;
notifications requesting side effects are ignored. Batches are limited to 100
requests. The maximum request body is 16 MiB.
Batch items must be request objects; nested batch arrays are rejected without
executing their contents. Invalid request IDs produce an error with `id:null`.

### Notes and media

Validate notes before creation when you need eligibility feedback. Validation
performs no downloads or media writes. `notes.createMany` normally commits each
item independently; `atomic:true` preflights the entire batch, including duplicates,
and adds it in one native transaction with one undo entry. Third-party add-on hook
I/O is outside this transaction.

Store media separately, then insert the **returned** filename into field HTML or
`[sound:filename]` references. The server may normalize or rename the requested
filename. `skipIfHash` compares incoming bytes; a skipped result has no filename
and promises no stored file. Explicit replacement journals the original file for
rollback on owned-write failure. Media writes cannot be undone with collection undo.
File paths refer to the machine running Anki. Files are limited to 64 MiB; for data
larger than the JSON body limit, use a path source. Socket read/write idle timeout
is ten seconds; accepted work has no implicit execution timeout.

### Scheduling and reviewer tokens

Use `scheduling.predict` to obtain the current `stateToken`, then pass that token
and an offered rating to `scheduling.answer`. Tokens are session-bound and become
invalid when the relevant state changes. For the active GUI reviewer, use
`reviewer.get` and the `reviewer.*` methods so custom scheduling and reviewer hooks
are respected. Show the answer before answering, and reacquire the reviewer token
after changing the displayed side or card.

Advanced card edits are restricted to validated metadata. History import adds
historical records, clears undo, and does not answer or reschedule cards.

## Method reference

Every JSON request below can be saved as `request.json` and sent with:

```bash
curl --request POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1 \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @request.json
```

Add the Authorization header if needed. Examples assume the referenced resources
exist. Replace example entity IDs, paths, profile names, and opaque tokens with
values from your Anki instance. The examples demonstrate individual calls; they
are not a script to run sequentially. Collection methods also accept optional
`session`. Parameter tables list all supported inputs, including defaults; unknown
input properties are rejected. Return types describe `result`, without the JSON-RPC
envelope. Clients should tolerate added response properties.

      }
    ],
    "atomic": true
  }
}
```

### `notes.update`

Apply fields and tags together in one native note update.

An affected classic/custom or Svelte browser editor saves pending edits before
the update and refreshes before the reply completes. This lets mining clients
attach media while the note is open. Multiple affected editors return
`editorConflict`; an editor already synchronizing an API update returns `busy`.
If refresh fails, `ioError` details include `writeCompleted`; reopen the editor
before editing again. A refresh failure does not roll back an applied update.

**Scope:** collection. **Completion:** completed. **Undo:** `single`.

**Parameters**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | [EntityId](#type-entityid) | Yes | — |
| `patch` | [NotePatch](#type-notepatch) | Yes | — |

  "method": "notes.update",
  "params": {
    "id": "1700000000001",

        "animals"
      ]
    }
  }
}

### `notes.convert`

Convert same-type notes through Anki note-type conversion.

**Scope:** collection. **Completion:** completed. **Undo:** `single`.

Mappings are complete target-name to source-name/null lists. Reject duplicate source mappings, mixed source note types and stale tokens. Removed source templates lose their cards/history as defined by Anki; cloze mappings use native supported rules, never raw mid assignment.

First call `notes.planConversion`. Use its `token` as `planToken` and adapt the returned complete field/template mappings. The token in this example is a placeholder.

Inactive reviewer returns null card/rendered/token, side=none and empty answers.

**Parameters**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `session` | [SessionId](#type-sessionid) | No | — |

**Returns**

[ReviewerState](#type-reviewerstate).

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "reviewer.get",
  "params": {}
}
```

### `reviewer.startTimer`

Restart the active reviewer card timer.

**Scope:** collection. **Completion:** completed. **Undo:** `none`.

Use the current `stateToken` from `reviewer.get`; the example token is a placeholder.

**Parameters**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stateToken` | string | Yes | Minimum length: 1. |
| `session` | [SessionId](#type-sessionid) | No | — |

**Returns**

[Ack](#type-ack).

**Errors:** `collectionUnavailable`, `conflict`, `internalError`, `invalidParams`, `invalidState`, `staleSession`.

**Example request**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "reviewer.startTimer",
  "params": {
    "stateToken": "replace-with-current-state-token"
  }
}
```

### `reviewer.showQuestion`

Show the question for the active reviewer card.

**Parameters**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stateToken` | string | Yes | Minimum length: 1. |
| `session` | [SessionId](#type-sessionid) | No | — |

**Returns**

[Ack](#type-ack).

**Errors:** `collectionUnavailable`, `conflict`, `internalError`, `invalidParams`, `invalidState`, `staleSession`.

**Example request**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "reviewer.showQuestion",
  "params": {
    "stateToken": "replace-with-current-state-token"
  }
}
```

### `reviewer.showAnswer`

Show the answer for the active reviewer card.

**Scope:** collection. **Completion:** completed. **Undo:** `none`.

Use the current `stateToken` from `reviewer.get`; the example token is a placeholder.

**Parameters**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stateToken` | string | Yes | Minimum length: 1. |
| `session` | [SessionId](#type-sessionid) | No | — |

**Returns**

  "method": "reviewer.showAnswer",
  "params": {
    "stateToken": "replace-with-current-state-token"
  }
}
```

On builds that guard question rendering, the action waits for Anki's native
question-ready callback before flipping. It rechecks the reviewer token and
cancels if review ends; rendering that does not complete within five seconds
returns a busy error instead of reporting an ignored flip as successful.

### `reviewer.answer`

Answer the active card using reviewer-retained states and await actual completion.

**Scope:** collection. **Completion:** operation. **Undo:** `single`.

Requires answer side and an offered rating. Success follows backend completion and UI notifications; reviewer hook veto returns vetoed.

Use the current `stateToken` from `reviewer.get`; the example token is a placeholder.

**Parameters**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stateToken` | string | Yes | Minimum length: 1. |
| `rating` | [Rating](#type-rating) | Yes | — |

[AnswerResult](#type-answerresult).

**Errors:** `collectionUnavailable`, `conflict`, `editorConflict`, `internalError`, `invalidParams`, `invalidState`, `staleSession`, `vetoed`.

**Example request**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "reviewer.answer",
  "params": {
    "stateToken": "replace-with-reviewer-state-token",
    "rating": "good"
  }
}
```

      "name": "Default"
    }
  }
}
```

  }
}
```

### `application.exit`

Acknowledge a close request, then initiate normal application close after sending the response.

**Scope:** application. **Completion:** completed. **Undo:** `none`.

**Parameters**

No parameters.

**Returns**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accepted` | `true` | Yes | — |

**Errors:** `internalError`, `invalidParams`.

}
```

## Advanced writes

### `advanced.cards.update`

Edit validated expert scheduling metadata through native card persistence.

**Scope:** collection. **Completion:** completed. **Undo:** `single`.

No id/noteId/deckId/template/queue/type/due/mod/usn writes. Moves, due changes and transitions use domain commands. Reject inconsistent coupled-state edits instead of inferring omitted state. Capability detection may restrict writable properties.

**Parameters**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cardId` | [EntityId](#type-entityid) | Yes | — |
| `patch` | [RawCardPatch](#type-rawcardpatch) | Yes | — |

**Example request**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "advanced.cards.update",
  "params": {
    "cardId": "1700000000002",
    "patch": {
      "customData": "{\"source\":\"vocabulary\"}"
    }
  }
}
```

### `advanced.reviews.import`

Import historical revlog records, not live answers.

**Scope:** collection. **Completion:** operation. **Undo:** `clears`.

Validate all records; reject duplicate IDs both internally and against collection. Derive answeredAt from ID, set usn=-1 locally. Records are imported in one database transaction. Do not change card scheduling/counters or claim a live answer. FSRS memory remains current stored state; later recomputation may consume imported history. Availability depends on runtime capability checks.

Use a unique review ID and an existing card ID. The example assumes an SM-2 historical record; do not infer its factor encoding from the current scheduler.

**Parameters**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reviews` | array of [ReviewImport](#type-reviewimport) | Yes | — |
| `session` | [SessionId](#type-sessionid) | No | — |

**Returns**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `operationId` | string | Yes | Minimum length: 1. |
| `method` | `"advanced.reviews.import"` | Yes | — |
| `session` | [SessionId](#type-sessionid) or null | Yes | — |

**Final operation result** (read with `operations.get`)

[Count](#type-count).

**Errors:** `collectionUnavailable`, `conflict`, `editorConflict`, `internalError`, `invalidParams`, `notFound`, `staleSession`, `unsupportedCapability`, `validationFailed`.

**Example request**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "advanced.reviews.import",
  "params": {
    "reviews": [
      {
        "id": "1791633600000",
        "cardId": "1700000000002",
        "rating": "good",
        "interval": {
          "value": 10,
          "unit": "days"
        },
        "previousInterval": {
          "value": 5,
          "unit": "days"
        },
        "factor": {
          "encoding": "legacySm2EasePermille",
          "value": 2500

  }
}
```

### `operations.cancel`

Request supported cancellation without claiming rollback.

**Scope:** application. **Completion:** completed. **Undo:** `none`.

Already terminal returns requested=false. Queued operations can cancel; running operations use native cancellation only. A cancellation request may lose a race with success.

Use an existing operation ID and inspect its `cancellable` property before requesting cancellation.

**Parameters**

| Property | Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `operationId` | string | Yes | Minimum length: 1. |

**Returns**
